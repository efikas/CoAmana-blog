Sequel to the interview today and as discussed, we are assigning you a 24 hour task to measure your ability with React. The task is as follows:

You will create a React.js blog listing application that lists posts from a WordPress blog API. You should read up on WordPress API at https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/ if you have not worked with it before especially about its result pagination. Also, I attached a sample HTTP response for you to know the basic properties included in the posts collection, It includes some custom properties added to make your life easier e.g 'featured_image', 'featured_image_thumbnail', formatted 'post_date' which are not included in the WordPress API by default.

Blog Posts Endpoint: https://epower.ng/wp-json/wp/v2/posts

Task Requirements
We should be able to view Blog Posts (6 posts per page).
Each blog post item should contain a featured image, post title & post excerpt.
We should be able to view the full content of a post by clicking the post item and the URL should include post slug.
There should be previous and next pagination routes.
Use of Redux is necessary for your implementation. As discussed, this is a 24 hour task with a deadline for 7pm tomorrow, Friday, August 30, 2019.
